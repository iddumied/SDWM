sdwm - dynamic window manager
============================
sdwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build sdwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sdwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sdwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running sdwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start sdwm using startx:

    exec sdwm

In order to connect sdwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec sdwm

(This will start sdwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of sdwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
